I am a Professor of Data Sciences/Statistics/Machine Learning at ENSAE,
Institut Polytechnique de Paris. 

I am interested in all aspects of **Bayesian computation**, that is,
algorithms to perform Bayesian inference. I am particularly interested in 

* Monte Carlo methods: particularly Sequential Monte Carlo, but also plain and
  Markov chain Monte Carlo;

* fast approximations: particularly Expectation Propagation. 

## Projects I'm involved with

* [B3DCMB](http://b3dcmb.in2p3.fr/): big bang from big data

## News

* forthcoming book on Sequential Monte Carlo, see [here](/books/).
