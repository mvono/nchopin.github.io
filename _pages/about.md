I am a Professor of Data Sciences/Statistics/Machine Learning at
[ENSAE](https://www.ensae.fr/en/), [Institut Polytechnique de
Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/en).

I am interested in all aspects of **Bayesian computation**, that is
algorithms to perform Bayesian inference, including: 

* Monte Carlo methods: particularly Sequential Monte Carlo, but also plain and
  Markov chain Monte Carlo;

* fast approximations: e.g. Expectation Propagation and variational Bayes.

## Projects I'm currently involved with 

* [B3DCMB](http://b3dcmb.in2p3.fr/): big bang from big data (funded by ANR)

* [Laplace's
  demon](https://ailab.criteo.com/laplaces-demon-bayesian-machine-learning-at-scale/):
  seminar about Bayesian machine learning at scale (supported by Criteo)

## Editorial responsibilities

I am currently an Associate editor for:

* Annals of Statistics

* Biometrika

* Journal of the Royal Statistical Series B 

I rarely find the time to review extra papers for other journals, sorry. 

## News

* forthcoming book on Sequential Monte Carlo, see [here](/books/).
