I am a Professor of Data Sciences/Statistics/Machine Learning at ENSAE,
Institut Polytechnique de Paris. 

I am interested in Bayesian computation, and in particular:

* Monte Carlo methods: particularly Sequential Monte Carlo, but also plain and
  Markov chain Monte Carlo;

* fast approximations: particularly Expectation Propagation. 

# NEWS

* forthcoming book on Sequential Monte Carlo, see [here](/books/).
