Software developed by me and/or co-authors for various previous papers:

* cabsde (python): Computational aspects of Bayesian spectral density estimation.

* py-smc2 (python): Pierre Jacob‘s implementation of SMC^2.

* truncgauss (python + C): Fast simulation of Truncated Gaussian distribution,
  see also Vincent Mazet’s Matlab implementation.

* ep-abc (matlab): EP-ABC (jointly written with Simon Barthelmé).
